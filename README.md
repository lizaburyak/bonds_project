# bonds_project
This is a code tables_from_pdfPto_exel.ipynb that accepts an array of pdf pages as input (example is interest rate forecastBCF0109mail.pdf â€“ and there were 250 of them), and translates them into Excel tables (examole is BCFF0109email.pdf First Quarter 2009). Then with code bonds.ipynb these Excel tables are transformed and combined into one common table (bonds_no_seasonal_effect)
